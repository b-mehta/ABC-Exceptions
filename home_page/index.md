# Exceptional set in the abc conjecture

We study solutions to the equation $$a + b = c$$, where $$a, b, c$$ form a triple of coprime natural numbers. The well-known abc conjecture asserts that, for any $$\varepsilon > 0$$, such triples satisfy $$\text{rad}(abc) \geq c ^ {1−\varepsilon}$$ with finitely many exceptions. In this ongoing project we aim to formalise a power-saving bound on the exceptional set of triples. Specifically, we show that there are $$O(X^{33/50})$$ integer triples $$(a, b, c) ∈ [1, X]^3$$, which satisfy $$\text{rad}(abc) < c ^ {1−\varepsilon}$$. The proof is based on a combination of bounds for the density of integer points on varieties, coming from the determinant method, Thue equations, geometry of numbers, and Fourier analysis.
We will follow the [paper of Browning, Lichtman and Teräväinen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12234)
