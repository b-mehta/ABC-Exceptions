# Exceptional set in the abc conjecture

We study solutions to the equation `a + b = c`, where `a, b, c` form a triple of coprime natural numbers. The well-known abc conjecture asserts that, for any `ε > 0`, such triples satisfy `rad(abc) ⩾ c ^ (1−ε)` with finitely many exceptions. In this ongoing project we aim to formalise a power-saving bound on the exceptional set of triples. Specifically, we show that there are `O(X^33/50)` integer triples `(a, b, c) ∈ [1, X]^3`, which satisfy `rad(abc) < c ^ (1−ε)`. The proof is based on a combination of bounds for the density of integer points on varieties, coming from the determinant method, Thue equations, geometry of numbers, and Fourier analysis.
